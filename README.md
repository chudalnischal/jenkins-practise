# Jenkins Practice

Welcome to the **Jenkins Practice** repository! This repository contains all of the automation projects and tasks that I am currently working on using Jenkins. 

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to showcasing different use cases of Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. As I continue to explore and implement new automation techniques, the repository will be updated accordingly.

## Getting Started

To get started with these automation tasks, ensure you have Jenkins set up in your environment. If you haven't already installed Jenkins, follow the [official Jenkins installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

### Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed on your local machine or server
- Docker (if using containerization)
- Git for version control
- Basic knowledge of Jenkins pipeline


### Upcoming Projects

Stay tuned for the following upcoming automation tasks with Jenkins:
- Automated testing with Jenkins and Selenium
- Continuous Deployment (CD) with Kubernetes
- Integrating Jenkins with Ansible for Configuration Management
- Jenkins Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile)

## Learning Resources

Here are some useful resources I've been using to learn Jenkins and CI/CD practices:
